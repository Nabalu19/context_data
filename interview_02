Girl: "The first thing we need to do is boil the spaghetti. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Then, add the spaghetti and cook it according to the package instructions. Don't forget to add some salt to the water to give the spaghetti some flavor."

Girl (voiceover): "While the spaghetti is cooking, we can start making the bolognese sauce. Heat a large pan over medium heat and add some olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and garlic and cook for a few minutes until they're soft and fragrant."
